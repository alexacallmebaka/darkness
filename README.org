* I love Darkness ðŸ¥¬

** This is no life
It doesn't feel right anymore. I feel that every time I write something for my
website, I have to dance to the tune of =pandoc= and =asciidoctor=. Maybe the Ruby
and Haskell Gods will take pity on me and my stuff will actually render as I
want them to. Oh... they didn't? Time to write a new =sed= script to fix that.

This is no life. Instead of fixing an issue at its root, I've been writing
[[https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/blob/legacy-source/sed/html.sed][fixes]], [[https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/blob/legacy-source/sed/adoc.sed][patches]], and [[https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/blob/legacy-source/Makefile][this]]. It was fun in the beginning! Mastering sed and awk,
the forbidden tools echoed from the past. However, as time went on and I wanted
to add more content and get more freedom, [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/web-legacy/][this pipeline]] felt limiting.

** A hero emerges
It is my honor and pleasure to introduce you to [[https://github.com/thecsw/Darkness][Darkness]]! The most noble static
website generator. The website you are on right now is built by her, with all
the images, styling, embeds, and more! The big advantage of Darkness is that she
is general enough (with a config file), so she can build any website for what
their heart desires.

Darkness currently takes a subset of orgmode files and creates an html file for
them. Orgmode is a markup language used by emacs, though it's very similar to
markdown. There is a getting started portion further! It will get you everything
you need to get comfortable with the process. Also, darkness is more agnostic
than just org->html. One just has to write a parser/exporter for a markup
language, enable it, and now we have multiple supported types!

** Plethora of features
Darkness supports a vast array of features and cool tricks, such as

- Project configuration with a [[https://github.com/thecsw/darkness/blob/master/ishmael/darkness.toml][simple toml file]]
- Smart headings (laid out and shifted as needed)
- Paragraphs with full [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html][orgmode-style formatting]]
- Lists with any text an breaking lines
- Good placement of images and its captions
- Embed support for: youtube, spotify, video, audio, etc.
- Raw HTML placement and export within the page
- Source code blocks with language selection
- Full math render support with [[https://katex.org][KaTeX]] (only enabled on pages with math)
- Smart Holoscene time annotations and layovers (just hover over H.E. times)
- Rich meta tags (OG/twitter-friendly) with previews enabled on every page
- Creating new darkness websites from a template (use =darkness new NAME=)
- Project cleanup and maintenance tools included with the binary
- Open-source code, PRs and contributions are welcome!

** Not only noble, but also super fast
Darkness is also lightning fast! With the old pipeline, it would take around
8-10 seconds to build my website. Darkness *only takes ~100ms* to do the same,
with IO and memory syscall times included. This is why [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/pprof/][profiling should be your
friend.]] She uses some cool parallelization tricks, so we spend around 1ms on
each page. Pretty cool if you ask me. Fastest (though admittedly larger) static
website generators took a bit more time in my experience.

** Getting started
Want to try out darkness but don't know orgmode? You are at the very start of
something beautiful, my friend! If you have go 1.18+ installed, run the command
below to get the latest version of her (you can also grab a suitable binary from
the [[https://github.com/thecsw/darkness/releases][releases]] page)

#+begin_src sh
  go install -v github.com/thecsw/darkness@latest
#+end_src

Next, go to the place, where you would like to hous your next website. Call her
with a =new= command followed by any name that feeds your soul (=ishmael= is an
example here)

#+begin_src sh
  darkness new ishmael
#+end_src

VoilÃ ! You have a new darkness project initiated. Change into that new directory
with =cd ishmael= and type in =darkness build=. You'll find an =index.html= in the
root, go open it! After that, look into =darkness.toml=, which shows you the
number of things you can play with to change the looks and feel.

Here is [[https://sandyuraz.com/ishmael][Ishmael's website]] that shows the formatting in action with many other
cool things! It's the template website that we just made above. I do hope you
find it fun here

** Formatting
Here is some orgmode and darkness formatting guide!

*** Sections

Every darkness input should start with the page's title. Page's title will look
in the form of =* Page's title= and every section on the website will start with
two or more astericks to show the heading level. So, =** Section= and =***
Subsection= will be put as a child of the former.

*** Formatting

You can separate text into paragraphs by adding a new line between them. Think
of an empty line as a delimeter. You should always add it between different
types of blocks you add to your page.

Simple formatting is supported as well, you can do some *bold* text, maybe even
/italics/, and =verbatim=. For =*bold*=, surround your text with astericks, for
=/italics/=, surround with forward slashes, and verbatim with equal signs,
==verbatim==
*** Links and embeds

Links are in the form of =[Â­[link][text]]=. If your link is in a text, then it will
show up as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael_(Moby-Dick)][such]]. If the link is on a separate line, darkness will decide if it
can be inserted as an embed (image, youtube, spotify song/playlist, video,
audio).

*** Images
See for example, below is a link on its line with an image path

[[https://sandyuraz.com/ishmael/evangelion.webp][/CUT/, August 2009 issue. Art by Tadashi Hiramatsu]]

*** Songs
Depending on the link type, darkness will intelligently stub in a preview if
it's a standalone link (not inlined within text). One more example

[[https://open.spotify.com/track/4cPnNnTMkJ6soUOUzEtmcp?si=ba1730fdb66642b9][Last Surprise]]

*** Lists

Lists are created by starting a line with a hyphen followed by an item
description, you would write something like

#+begin_src
  - This is my first item
  - This second item is going to be so long that I would
  have to break it down into two line
  - Third item follows swiftly
#+end_src

It will render as follows

- This is my first item
- This second item is going to be so long that I would
  have to break it down into two line
- Third item follows swiftly

*** Source code blocks

Source code blocks follow [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-Source-Code.html][orgmode]]'s conventions. You would wrap your source code
with =#+begin_src LANG= and =#+end_src=, where =LANG= is the language of the source
code block. You can leave =LANG= empty as well. 

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src c
  main( ) {
          printf("hello, world");
  }
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

Will render as (hover over the block to see the language)

#+begin_src c
  main( ) {
          printf("hello, world");
  }
#+end_src

*** HTML injection

Whatever darkness provides can still be limiting if you want to insert some of
your own material or embeds that are not supported. Do you give up? Hopefully
not. Anything surrounded by =#+begin_export html= and =#+end_export= will be inserted
literally into the page. 

#+begin_export html
<script src="https://gist.github.com/thecsw/c80f83c0d52c0a476e86fc9a6a980517.js"></script>
#+end_export

This is the embed source for the above

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_export html
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/thecsw/c80f83c0d52c0a476e86fc9a6a980517.js"></script>
  ,#+end_export
#+end_src

*** Attention blocks

You may need to grab reader's attention even more or make them aware of some
sharp edges in whatever you're writing about. Start a paragraph with =NOTE:=,
=IMPORTANT:=, =CAUTION:=, =TIP:=, or =WARNING:=, and you will get an attention-grabber

TIP: This is kinda useful for technical posts when you mention exceptions or so 

*** Footnotes

Another cool thing darkness can do for you is keeping track of your
footnotes. We follow orgmode's conventions as well. Anywhere in the text, if
you have a string in the form of =[fnÂ­:: blablabla]=, that =blablabla= will go and
become your footnote. [fn:: /Formatting/ *also* =works= in footnotes]

** Niche features
See this cool trick of cleaning up the project with =megumin=!

** Why "Darkness"?

Her name is based one one of the characters I love from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KonoSuba][KonoSuba]]
